## Moqlati Stremlet: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
Welcome to the Moqlati Stremlet platform, designed to facilitate the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through advanced analysis of fundus images. This initiative aims to enhance diabetic care by providing healthcare professionals and patients with tools for timely diagnosis and intervention.

Overview
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss and blindness in individuals with diabetes. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. Our platform leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze fundus images, identifying potential signs of diabetic retinopathy and aiding in prompt medical evaluation.

Features
Automated Image Analysis: Utilize pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze fundus images with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Easily upload images and receive instant feedback on the risk of diabetic retinopathy.
Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports summarizing the analysis and risk assessment for informed decision-making.
